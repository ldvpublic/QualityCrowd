II. Installation
----------------
 1. Place all files in a directory inside your webservers document 
    root

 	with .php.default and remove the .default part of the filename.
 	You can do this by running
 		./app/config/setup.sh

 3. Create an empty database and fill in the database credentials in
 	/app/config/database.php

 4. Set 'baseurl' in /app/config/general.php to the URL under which 
 	the application will be accessible via webbrowser.

 5. cd to your install directory and run 
    	./cake/console/cake schema create
    to create the database scheme

 6. Run the following SQL statement in your database to add an initial
    user account:
    	INSERT INTO `users` (`id`, `username`, `password`) VALUES
    	(1, 'admin', 'ec08d2cec79f3bb56ac8b8b0ba95541c205c2841');

 7. The basic setup is ready and you should be able to log in using
 		username: admin
 		password: admin


To use QualityCrowd with Mechanical Turk make you have to install the
Mechanical Turl Command Line Tools 
<http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/694> which is used as an API 
wrapper. After that you can enable Mechanical Turk support in 
/app/config/amazon.php. You can get the access and secret key from the
AWS portal <https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials>.

Same thing is for Amazon S3 and Cloudfront support. Just fill in the 
required parameters in /app/config/amazon.php. If you do not activate
Amazon S3 the video files will be delivered by the QualityCrowd server.

And last but not least to enabled the interface to CrowdFlower you can
provide your credentials in /app/config/crowdflower.php and set 
'cf.enabled' to true.

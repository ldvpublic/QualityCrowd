                         QualityCrowd
 
I. Description
--------------

Video quality assessment with subjective testing is both time 
consuming and expensive. An interesting new approach to traditional 
testing is the so-called crowdsourcing, moving the testing effort into
the internet. We therefore propose in this contribution the 
QualityCrowd framework to effortlessly perform subjective quality 
assessment with crowdsourcing. QualityCrowd allows codec independent 
quality assessment with a simple web interface, usable with common 
web browsers.

QualityCrowd interfaces with
 * Amazon Mechanical Turk <https://www.mturk.com/>
 * CloudFlower <http://www.crowdflower.com/>
 * Amazon S3/CloudFront <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/>

QualityCrowd is based on CakePHP 1.3 <http://www.cakephp.org/>, a nice
PHP MVC framework.

QualityCrowd is not a finished software product. It is rather ment as 
an toolkit or framework and will surely need some further 
customizations to fit your requirements.
